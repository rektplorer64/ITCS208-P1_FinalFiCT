# Project 1: Final FiCT (reads Final Fi-See-Tee)
A student project. Mahidol University, Faculty of ICT: ITCS 208 â€“ Object Oriented Programming

This is a program that simulates the gameplay of a turn-based two teams
battle game, Final FiCT.

Final FiCT is a simple turn-based battle game between two teams: Team A and Team B. Similar examples
include the battle scenes of Final Fantasy I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X, Summoners War, and
Fate/Grand Order. However, in this programming project, the program is a simple, deterministic mechanism of the game.
