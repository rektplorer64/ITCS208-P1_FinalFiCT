# Project 1: Final FiCT 
A student project. Mahidol University, Faculty of ICT: ITCS 208 â€“ Object Oriented Programming

This is a program that simulates the gameplay of a turn-based two teams
battle game, Final FiCT.

#### Description

Final FiCT (reads Final Fi-See-Tee) is a simple turn-based battle game between two teams: Team A and Team B. Similar examples
include the battle scenes of Final Fantasy I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X, Summoners War, and
Fate/Grand Order. However, in this programming project, the program is a simple, deterministic mechanism of the game.

#### Learning Objectives: 
On the course of implementing this programming project, you will learn some of the basic concepts of object oriented programming and how to apply them to practical, real world programming applications. Specifically, upon accomplishing this project, we expect you to be able to: 
1. Differentiate and explain the purposes of: 
   - `private`, `public`, `static`, and `final` class variables. 
   - `static`, `void`, and returning methods. 
2. Implement `class`es. 
3. Instantiate objects from a class and use constructors to initialize objects.  
4. Model entities and situations using objects, each of which has certain properties and exhibits certain abilities. 
5. Strengthen your overall programming skills.  
6. Get a glimpse of needs for abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
7. Enjoy coding with Java.
